## 🧨 Bonus points

Explain why the result of `('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase()` is `banana`.

**Answer:**

- **+ 'a'** convert "a" to number, but "a" is not a number, so + 'a' returns NaN.

- We have: 'b' + 'a' = 'ba'

- So: 'ba' + NAN + a = "baNANa"

- Finaly: "banana".toLowerCase() => "banana"
